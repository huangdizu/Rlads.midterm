refrain i need you now read letters that i wrote on the wall and the message that i left on my car i need you now words that said drowned out by the rain waiting there for you but you never came my world's a little colder now but i'm keeping warm somehow   so here you are at my window guess nobody told you i don't need you don't need you and i waited so frustrated who's gonna hold you i don't need you don't need you now  refrain i need you now words i heard you whispered to me and we will walk you down a oneway street you need me now that's what you've been telling my friends but i'd come too far to go back there again my heart my mind my mother's a chain your mind as well forget my name   so here you are at my window guess nobody told you i don't need you don't need you and i waited so frustrated who's gonna hold you i don't need you don't need you now   i need you now read letters that i wrote on the wall and the message that i left on my car   so here you are at my window guess nobody told you i don't need you don't need you and i waited so frustrated who's gonna hold you i don't need you now   and i'm not what you want i won't wonder where you are i won't dream a thousand stars i don't need you now i don't need you by the rain and i never heard you say i need you i need you i don't need you now don't need you i don't need you now
