tony was a friend of mine we were together all the time he had my back once he really saved my life  pre sometimes i wanna call him say hey let's stay up 'til morning   and when i close my eyes when i close my eyes i see you you when i close my eyes when i close my eyes you come through you time just deepens sweetens and mends old friends   we all melt back into the picture raindrops back into the water old friends hmm hmm and there are no ends to old friends amen
