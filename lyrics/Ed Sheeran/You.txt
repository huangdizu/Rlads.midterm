wiley the thoughts i have could be clear ones they can seem vivid the goals i reach are not near ones the further the limit i block her out so when i'm looking though my mind she ain't in it can i be free for a minute can i be me for a minute the thoughts i have can be dark ones even be smart ones i know i'm gonna have a couple straight from the heart ones tell you what i think i will until i depart mum it's you that i live for i'm the first and the last one to love you lots what's better than thinking about the ones you love nothing much when you're thinking about the ones you love i feel the same when i'm on the floor see the sun above unconditional like bills payed when i've run 'em up no one here to help you pay now you're gonna moan no one here to save the day now you're all alone wish i was born with a golden spoon in my mouth fact is i wasn't so i'm coming from a quarter zone  hook ed sheeran and when the sun falls down i'll be up again and never close my eyes and if the dawn might break i'll see nothing when nothing when my thoughts are only you and my mind is over you my thoughts are over you and these words are all for you now for you   wiley i wanna see you happy i wanna see you smile cause you've been trespassing and you won't leave my mind now i've been thinking about this you told me say yes nan i'm  now i'm still saying yes nan you had to replace my mum dad two parents in one i know you're proud staring at your grandson i found a job i like got the flat the cars to buy got the quad i like and cause of you and kylie it's in every single song i write had a golden life wanted people to honour mine tell 'em while i'm here cause one day i'm gonna die and when i'm gone i want my music to play and when my people listen to this track it's gonna make 'em wanna cry i ain't gonna lie i think about the scene i made i say the game's better it's a must now i've gotta fly my talents gonna shine real shortly fam i know it i work round the clock i don't stop at night  hook x
